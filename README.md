BYO Joystick allows you to use your HOTAS, keyboard, and other input devices with VTOL VR.

It has a user friendly interface for binding controls on a per aircraft basis and supports both multiplayer and multicrew vehicles.

EDIT:
Hi I'm Tatune and i'm making this fork to add a support to interact with the cockpit using a VR virtual cursor instead of having to bump my hands all over the place on my desk or hotas.
